# Quotidiano

Quotidiano ('Daily' in Italian) is a program I created in order to help me study Italian daily. It is a tool that helps the user meet some
daily quota on vocabulary to learn. Once finished, the data is copied with some delimter, like "/", and given to some 3rd party notecard
software like Quizlet.
